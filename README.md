# Modal with Login and Registration Forms

This project demonstrates how to create a modal popup with two forms: a **login form** and a **registration form**. The modal automatically opens when the page is loaded, allowing users to toggle between the login and registration forms.

## Features

- **Automatic Modal Popup**: The modal appears when the page is loaded without requiring a button click.
- **Login and Registration Forms**: Two forms inside the modalâ€”one for login and one for registration.
- **Form Toggle**: Users can easily switch between the login form and the registration form within the modal.
- **Close Modal**: The modal can be closed by clicking the **close button** or anywhere outside the modal content.

## Getting Started

- A web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) for editing the code.
